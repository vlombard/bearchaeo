# bearchaeo
Ontologies for the archaeological and archaeometric projects, from the excavations to the analyses to the forms. 
These ontologies have been developed for the EU project "Beyond archaeology" (BeArchaeo) 

The file bearchaeo_merge_all.owl imports all the sub-ontologies to create the merged beArchaeo ontology.
